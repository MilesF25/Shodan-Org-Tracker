# Shodan-Org-Tracker


This project was inspired by my shodan project. I kind of made it up as i went so excuse how messy it is.


## Goal


The goal of this project is to create a tool that allows users to track and analyze organizations using the Shodan API. The user will be able to input an organization name and its known assets and the queries to find it. The tool will then use the Shodan API to search for assets. If the tool finds assets that don't match anything that is known it will raise a flag. (Pivoting)

Currently on hold, i don't know how to best proceed with this project. The down side of making things up as you goal is that you hit road blocks. I forgot Shodan only scans for public devices, not private ones. not really sure how to continue this
